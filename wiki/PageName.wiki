Introduction:

FPGA Implementation of Kalman Filters: Kalman filters are widely used in signal processing applications and there is a rich literature on their implementation on FPGA platforms. One particularly useful version is the extended Kalman filter (EKF). We are considering the implementation of the EKF on the Spartan 3 500E.

Things to do:
Model verification using MATLAB so that the algorithm is clearly understood and appreciated. 

Simulink design of the model so as to get a picture of how to model the system using blocks and control the flow of data and timing.

Xilinx implementation of the system using System Generator, with special consideration to timing and accuracy of the design.

Updates:

Get the update equations right. To do this we'll have to talk to Prof. Ebbini.

Control scheme and  P update has to be fixed. 

Integration loop, for both 32 and also the bigger 347 loop has to be figured out.

Hardware coSim comes after this.
